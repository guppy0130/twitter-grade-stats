# Twitter-Grade-Stats

A spinoff of an AP Stats project, now personalized!

Express application that takes in a Twitter handle and returns statistics about the Tweets from that account. Currently serves only webpages. Displays a pretty, modern HTML5 canvas chart of grade levels and a superimposed Normal distribution to show how Normal we are.

Thanks to the [jstat/jstat library](https://github.com/jstat/jstat) for Normal distribution calculations.
